# Zomato-Food-Analysis
The **Zomato Food Analysis** project aims to provide an analysis of Zomato Food Datasets(Hotels of Different cities of India). In this repo, you'll find a precise and perfect Power BI report and the website built using Django. You can have a look at the website [here](https://zomato.pythonanywhere.com/). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6mTN6G-adM&t=307s) is the reference for Hosting tutorial.  

## Datasets
We've got the datasets in the raw form as you can see [here](Datasets/Raw-Datasets) where we have the different folder for each cities(total around 80 cities) and the hotel details in `.csv` files for each cities, see [this](Datasets/Raw-Datasets/Ahmedabad) for reference.

 ### Data Pre-processing
 As you can see in [this](Datasets/Raw-Datasets/Ahmedabad/1-Ahmedabadhotels.csv) file, the delimiter is `|` and thus *NAME*, *PRICE* ... *VOTES* are all the different columns.
